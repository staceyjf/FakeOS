## About the Web App

FakeOS is meticulously crafted with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS to recreate the nostalgic feel of the old-school Macintosh OS.

## Key learning highlights

1. **CSS Positioning**: Deepened understanding of `position: relative` and its impact on the normal flow of items.
2. **Working with SVG Files**: Learned the nuances of SVG files compared to img tags.
3. **Modular JavaScript**: Divided JavaScript code into logic and DOM modules for improved maintainability and readability.

## Challenges

1. **Modal Interaction**: Overcame challenges in using icons to open modals by leveraging HTML custom data attributes for passing data to event listeners.
2. **Asset Selection**: Faced difficulties in sourcing the right images and font to complement the design.

## To-Dos

1. **Dynamic Icon Addition**: Implement functionality to dynamically add icons which open to stored user notes.
2. **Event Delegation**: Explore event delegation to streamline event listener functions such as `modalHandlerOpen` and `modalHandlerClose`.
