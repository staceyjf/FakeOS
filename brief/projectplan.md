## Hints

- Split your js logic/data modules from your js DOM modules
- Look at the position css property, specifically _fixed_ and _absolute_
- Pay attention to your hierarchy of elements in your html
- Create your modals using JS and DOM interaction
- Make your life easy! You don't need to recreate everything, just do the features and mvp mentioned above

### Overall

#### features

    - icons with three working apps

### Element - desktop

### Element - selectable menu

#### requirements

    - Selecting the menu will display a list of text and icons
    - Menu contains a flex with content inside it

### Element - current time

#### requirements

    - time needs to update in realtime eg be refreshed

### Element - icons - "apps"

#### requirements

    - selecting an icon will open an "app", creating a _modal_ to display some content
    - Apps should be able to contain text, an image or a form

What is a modal -
A modal is a type of dialog box or popup that appears in the same window of a website or application, usually to request user interaction. It is called a "modal" because it creates a mode that disables the main window but keeps it visible in the background. The user must interact with the modal (e.g., close it or fill out a form) before they can return to the main window. Modals are commonly used for things like login forms, notifications, and additional information prompts.
